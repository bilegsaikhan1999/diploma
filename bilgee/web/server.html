                        <p>A server is a computer or system that provides resources, data, services, or programs to other computers, known as clients,
                             over a network. In theory, whenever computers share resources with client machines they are considered servers. There are
                              many types of servers, including web servers, mail servers, and virtual servers.</p>     
                    </div>                
                    <div class="webpage-paragarh">
                        <p>An individual system can provide resources and use them from another system at the same time. This means that a device could be both a server and a client at the same time.</p>
                        <p>Some of the first servers were mainframe computers or minicomputers. Minicomputers were much smaller than mainframe computers, hence the name. However, as technology
                            progressed, they ended up becoming much larger than desktop computers, which made the term microcomputer somewhat farcical.</p>
                        <h1 class="paragarh-garchig">How a server works?</h1>
                        <p>To function as a server, a device must be configured to listen to requests from clients on a network connection. This functionality can exist
                             as part of the operating system as an installed application, role, or a combination of the two.</p>

                            <h1>Application servers</h1>
                            <p>Application servers run applications in lieu of client computers 
                                running applications locally. Application servers often run resource-intensive 
                                applications that are shared by a large number of users.Doing so removes the need for each client to have sufficient resources to run the applications. It also removes the need to install and maintain software on many machines as opposed to only one.</p>

                            <h1>Mail servers</h1>
                            <p>Mail servers are a very common type of application server. Mail servers receive emails sent 
                               to a user and store them until requested by a client on behalf of said user.Having an email server allows for a single machine to be properly configured and attached to the network at all times. It is then ready to send and receive messages rather than requiring every client machine to have its own email subsystem continuously running.</p>

                            <p>One of the most abundant types of servers in today’s market is a web server. A web server is a special kind of application server 
                                that hosts programs and data requested by users across the Internet or an intranet.Web servers respond to requests from browsers running on client computers for web pages, or other web-based services. Common web servers include Apache web servers, Microsoft Internet Information Services (IIS) servers and Nginx servers.</p>
